# Comprehensive-Health-Data-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning-Predictions
This Jupyter notebook is a detailed exploration of health-related data analysis, featuring a variety of data processing techniques, statistical evaluations, and machine learning modeling.
 The notebook begins with the necessary data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by descriptive statistics that give insights into patient demographics, healthcare costs, and treatment outcomes. Key visualizations are included to highlight the distribution of patient ages, average healthcare costs by gender, and treatment outcome frequencies. The notebook progresses to advanced analysis with a correlation heatmap illustrating the relationships between variables.

A significant portion of the notebook is dedicated to building a machine learning pipeline that pre-processes the data, encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical ones. A linear regression model is then trained to predict healthcare costs, but it indicates poor performance with a negative R-squared value, suggesting that further model refinement or the use of more complex algorithms might be necessary. The analysis concludes with a critical evaluation of the model's predictive accuracy, represented visually by comparing actual versus predicted healthcare costs.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for data scientists and analysts interested in the intersection of healthcare and data analytics, offering a template for similar studies and a starting point for further research and development in predictive modeling within the healthcare sector.
